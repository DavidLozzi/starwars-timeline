      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-85&character=Maz Kanata">Maz Kanata</a>

          Maz Kanata, Force-sensitive, was born over a millennium before the brewing war between the First Order and the
          Resistance. Living in an ancient castle on the planet Takodana, Kanata gained a reputation as a &quot;pirate
          queen&quot; by allowing traveling smugglers to reside in her homeâ€”as long as they honored her prohibitions
          against politics and war. Kanata spent centuries traveling the galaxy, collecting antiques and trinkets, which
          she kept inside the storehouses and vaults of her castle. One notable item was the lightsaber crafted by Jedi
          Knight Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, and later wielded by Skywalker's son, Luke, who was
          instrumental in toppling the Galactic Empire.
        </li>

          rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but
          revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Grand Master of
          the Jedi Order. Having lived through nine centuries of galactic history, he played integral roles in the Clone
          Wars, the rebirth of the Jedi through Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-85&character=Jabba Desilijic Tiure">Jabba Desilijic
            Tiure</a>

          Excellency Jabba Desilijic Tiure of Nal Hutta, Eminence of Tatooine, was a Hutt gangster and crime lord, as
          well as a member of the Grand Hutt Council, who operated and led a criminal empire from his palace on the
          Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the piracy,
          slavery, and trafficking in illegal goods that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly
          influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.
        </li>

          resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the Cold War and subsequent First
          Order/Resistance War. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the
          Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow
          captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces of the Kachirho Wookiee
          Militia during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi General Yoda.
          During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme
          Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Chieftain and General Tarfful,
          Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.
        </li>

          years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic
          conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war
          he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-84&character=Sheev Palpatine">Sheev Palpatine</a>

          Sheev Palpatine, and also known simply as the Emperor, was a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious, and
          Emperor of the Galactic Empire, ruling from 19 BBY to 4 ABY. Rising to power in the Republic Senate as the
          senator of Naboo, the secretive Sith Lord cultivated two identities, Sidious and Palpatine, using both to
          further his political career. He orchestrated the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order through the
          Clone Wars, and then established his reign over the galaxy which lasted until his death at the Battle of
          Endor. However, the dark side of the Force gave rise to powers which allowed the Emperor to return from the
          grave.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-82&character=Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a>

          the best bounty hunter in the galaxy during the final years of the Galactic Republic, Fett was proficient in
          marksmanship as well as unarmed combat. The Mandalorian armor that he wore featured various weapons and
          gadgets, including a flamethrower, dual WESTAR-34 blaster pistols, and a jetpack. His personal starship was
          the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-80&character=Mace Windu">Mace Windu</a>

          Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi
          Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the
          corrupt, declining days of the Republic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-80&character=Qui-Gon Jinn">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>

          Qui-Gon Jinn, was Force-sensitive, venerable if maverick Jedi Master who lived during the last years of the
          Republic Era. He was a wise and well-respected member of the Jedi Order, and was offered a seat on the Jedi
          Council, but chose to reject and follow his own path. Adhering to a philosophy centered around the Living
          Force, Jinn strove to follow the will of the Force even when his actions conflicted with the wishes of the
          High Council. After encountering Anakin Skywalker, Jinn brought him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, convinced
          he had found the Chosen One. His dying wish was for Skywalker to become a Jedi and ultimately restore balance
          to the Force.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-69&character=Nute Gunray">Nute Gunray</a>

          Nute Gunray served as the Viceroy of the Trade Federation and a high-ranking member of the Separatist
          Confederacy of Independent Systems and chairman of the Separatist Council. Gunray led the Trade Federation
          through its invasion of the planet Naboo, at the behest of the Sith Lord Darth Sidiousâ€”who was secretly Sheev
          Palpatine, the Senator of Naboo, and who had engineered the conflict to be elected Supreme Chancellor. The
          Federation invasion was repelled and Gunray was arrested, but he avoided punishment after four trials in the
          Supreme Court.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-65&character=Saw Gerrera">Saw Gerrera</a>

          Confederacy of Independent Systems on Onderon during the Clone Wars. He and his younger sister, Steela
          Gerrera, were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their homeworld during the Onderonian Civil War. He
          later became a key member in the fight against the Galactic Empire and the formation of the Alliance to
          Restore the Republic. His tactics against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety
          was recognized by the Empire and, many years later, the New Republic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-65&character=General Grievous">General Grievous</a>

          Grievous, born as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a warlord who served as a commanding officer within the military
          forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Despite his
          position as a general, Grievous held the title of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Army that
          engaged the Grand Army of the Republic in the pan-galactic Clone Wars. Noted for being ruthless and his
          extensive cybernetic enhancements, Grievous instilled fear throughout the entire galaxy as he traveled,
          invading planets and engaging the Jedi Knights of the Republic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-64&character=Wilhuff Tarkin">Wilhuff Tarkin</a>

          Republic and the Age of the Empire. Born on the planet Eriadu in 64 BBY, he was a member of the Tarkin family
          and the great-nephew of Jova Tarkin. During the Republic Era, Tarkin served in the Galactic Republic's
          Judicial Department for a time before returning to his homeworld as the Governor of Eriadu. When the Clone

          Jar Jar Binks was a military commander and politician who played a key role during the Invasion of Naboo and
          the Clone Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once
          an outcast from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior, he regained favor with his people by helping secure
          an alliance between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen PadmÃ© Amidala of Naboo, an alliance vital in ending
          the Trade Federation's invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that followed, Binks became a Junior
          Representative for his people in the Galactic Senate, serving alongside Amidala once she became the planet's
          senator.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-60&character=Bail Organa">Bail Organa</a>

          Bail Prestor Organa was an Alderaanian politician and revolutionary leader, an influential voice for peace in
          the Galactic Senate during the last days of the Galactic Republic, and a founding member of the Alliance to
          Restore the Republic. Organa, the senator of Alderaan, was an outspoken member of the Senate's Loyalist
          Committee that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He became an architect of
          the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and believed that a full-scale Galactic Civil War was
          inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a New Republic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-57&character=Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>

          Obi-Wan Kenobi, also known as Ben Kenobi, was a Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the
          final years of the Republic Era. As a Jedi General, Kenobi served in the Grand Army of the Republic that
          fought against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. Kenobi, however, was forced into exile as a
          result of the Great Jedi Purge. As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for training two members of the Skywalker
          family, Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, both of whom served in turn as his Padawan in the ways of the
          Force.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-54&character=Count Dooku">Count Dooku</a>

          Dooku, Force-sensitive, was a Jedi Master that fell to the dark side of the Force and became the Dark Lord of
          the Sith Darth Tyranus during the final years of the Galactic Republic. After leaving the Jedi Order, he
          claimed the title Count of Serenno and, during the Clone Wars, served as Head of State of the Confederacy of
          Independent Systems. He was the second apprentice of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith whose plan to
          conquer the galaxy relied on Dooku leading a pan-galactic secessionist movement against the Republic. As such,
          Dooku immersed himself in the dark side and worked tirelessly to advance his and his master's plans, but
          ultimately forgot that treachery was the way of the Sith.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-54&character=Darth Maul">Darth Maul</a>

          Maul, once known as Darth Maul, was Force-sensitive who established himself as a crime lord during the reign
          of the Galactic Empire. However, he was once the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord
          of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side
          and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to
          power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-52&character=Owen Lars">Owen Lars</a>

          Owen Lars was a moisture farmer from the desert planet Tatooine. He was the son of Aika and Cliegg Lars, and
          he became the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker when Cliegg married Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker.
          In 22 BBY, Shmi was killed by Tusken Raiders, and Cliegg passed away soon after. Lars married his girlfriend,
          Beru Whitesun, and they toiled to maintain the homestead.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-50&character=Thrawn">Thrawn</a>

          Thrawn, born as Kivu'raw'nuru with the core name Vurawn, recognized in his early military career as
          Mitth'raw'nuru, was an officer of the Chiss Ascendancy and Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy during the age
          of the Galactic Empire. An alien Imperial officer with striking blue skin, red eyes, and an angular face,
          Thrawn was well known as a brilliant and ruthless strategist. He believed that in order to achieve victory in
          war, one must know their enemy. As such, he dedicated himself to understanding the philosophy, art, and
          culture of his opponents, which included the Twi'leks of Ryloth and the warriors of Mandalore. When Governor
          Arihnda Pryce requested a strong commander capable of defeating the rebels on Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn
          accepted the challenge, intending to dismantle the rebellion one piece at a time.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-50&character=Babu Frik">Babu Frik</a>

          Resistance. He maintained a workshop where he worked as a droidsmith among the Spice Runners of Kijimi. He
          could reprogram or modify almost any droid, regardless of its security measures. He spoke a fractured, heavily
          accented form of Basic known as Anzellan.
        </li>

          Beru Lars, born Beru Whitesun, was married to Owen Lars, the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker,
          whose son, Luke Skywalker, they raised during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Lars was killed along with her
          husband by Imperial stormtroopers, who also burned down the Lars moisture farm. With their deaths, Skywalker
          left his homeworld and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-46&character=Mon Mothma">Mon Mothma</a>

          Mon Mothma was a politician and revolutionary leader who served in the Galactic Senate and Imperial Senate as
          the representative of Chandrila, the leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the first Chancellor
          of the New Republic. Mothma came to political prominence during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars when,
          along with such allies as Senators Bail Prestor Organa and PadmÃ© Amidala, she became an outspoken proponent of
          peace between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She also spoke out against the
          increase in executive power given to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who transformed the Republic into the
          Empire at the war's end.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-46&character=PadmÃ© Amidala Naberrie">PadmÃ© Amidala
            Naberrie</a>

          PadmÃ© Amidala Naberrie was a senator who represented the people of Naboo during the final years of the
          Galactic Republic. Prior to her career in the Galactic Senate, Amidala was the elected ruler of the Royal
          House of Naboo. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of democracy as well as a peaceful
          resolution to the Clone Wars. However, her secret marriage to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would have a
          lasting effect on the future of the galaxy for decades to come. She was the mother of Luke and Leia.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=-45&character=Bo-Katan Kryze">Bo-Katan Kryze</a>

          Bo-Katan Kryze was the leader of the Nite Owls and a lieutenant in Death Watch, a terrorist group, and later
          during the Imperial Era, became Mand'alor. During the Clone Wars, Kryze's sister, Satine, ruled as the Duchess
          of Mandalore, and Kryze sought to undo her pacifistic teachings, believing that Mandalore should take pride in

          the splinter group was exiled from the Mandalore system. In 19 BBY, Kryze and Vizsla discovered the Sith Lords
          Maul and Savage Opress. With the Sith, they plotted to reclaim Mandalore, and through Maul's planning, united
          several criminal syndicates to form the Shadow Collective. Launching a takeover of Mandalore, Satine's rule
          was overthrown, and Vizsla took control of the planet.

          Ahsoka Tano was a Force-sensitive Togruta, former Jedi Padawan who, after the Clone Wars, helped establish a
          network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by
          Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the
          outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi
          Knight Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her &quot;Snips&quot; when she joined him at the Battle of
          Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they
          had a rather difficult start as master and apprentice. Yet they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of
          crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance
          between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.

          manufactured by Industrial Automaton with masculine programming. A smart, spunky droid who would serve a
          multitude of masters over his lifetime, R2-D2 was never given a full memory wipe (apart from a partial wipe of
          select information by Cad Bane during the senate hostage crisis) nor did he ever receive new programming, with
          these factors resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments
          in galactic history, his bravery and ingenuity saved the galaxy on numerous occasions.

          constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the
          galaxy on many occasions.

          of the Galactic Empire. Originally code-named Alpha, he was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty
          hunter Jango Fett. Boba emulated his father and genetic donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian
          armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged
          to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty
          hunters in the galaxy during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. He became a legend over the course of his career,
          which included contracts for both the Empire and the extensive criminal underworld.

          Han Solo, known only as Han until being given the surname Solo by an Imperial recruitment officer, and
          formerly known as Cadet 124-329 while serving as an Imperial cadet, was also a smuggler. He became a leader in
          the Alliance to Restore the Republic and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the Galactic Empire during
          the Galactic Civil War. He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler, even completing the Kessel Run in just
          twelve parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon, and coming under the employ of Jabba the Hutt. He
          was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator PadmÃ© Amidala, husband of Princess Leia
          Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow
          smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted copilot who swore a life
          debt to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble
          with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he
          agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, but he became
          caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Princess Leia Organa escape from the Death
          Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the superweapon. Solo fought
          with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the
          Empire.

          White Worms. Though they were at first rivals, the two scrumrats eventually became lovers. Sometime after
          Qi'ra was made Head Girl by Lady Proxima, Han and Qi'ra attempted to escape with a vial of coaxium, but were

          Din Djarin, also known as &quot;the Mandalorian&quot; or simply &quot;Mando,&quot; was a Mandalorian who
          worked as a famous bounty hunter during the New Republic Era. With his Mandalorian armor, IB-94 blaster
          pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmaticâ€”a
          stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. Orphaned during the Republic Era, he was raised as a
          foundling by the Children of the Watch, a group that had broken off from mainstream Mandalorian society.
          Djarin was not aware of this and believed that all Mandalorians followed the Children of the Watch's beliefs.
          He was trained to become a Mandalorian warrior and eventually joined the Tribe, which operated in a secret
          covert on Nevarro and was affiliated with the Children of the Watch. Djarin became battle-hardened, a man of
          few words, and a formidable hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy.

          During the early days of the Galactic Empire, when Clone Force 99 landed on Pantora, Shand took it upon
          herself to capture the clone girl Omega who had a bounty placed on her. She managed to gain Omega's trust, but
          betrayed Omega and her friends when clone commando sergeant Hunter came to rescue her. She fought off Wrecker,
          another member of Clone Force 99, and chased Omega to the top of a tower. Shand dropped Omega onto a

          Armitage Hux served as a general in the military forces of the First Order during the New Republic Era. With
          the support of Supreme Leader Snoke, Hux took command of Starkiller Base and promoted the development of new
          technology that allowed the First Order fleet to track targets through hyperspace. However, Snoke's death
          ruined the young general's career trajectory, as did the years that Hux spent jockeying for power against his
          rival Kylo Ren, who seized control of the First Order as the new Supreme Leader.

          the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot,
          serving the New Republic Defense Fleet as the commander of Rapier Squadron, but grew disillusioned with the
          Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the Galactic Concordance. Dameron defected to the
          Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the
          callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing starfighter, Black One.

          Snoke was a Force-sensitive humanoid strandcast who ruled the First Order as Supreme Leader during the New
          Republic Era. Possibly unaware of his true nature, Snoke was an artificial genetic construct created on the
          planet Exegol by the resurrected Dark Lord of the Sith and former Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. Cloned from
          Sidious with various genetic sciences, Snoke was designed to be a proxy that the Sith Lord could manipulate,
          though he possessed an independent mind and free will.

          Ben Solo, Force-sensitive, fell to the dark side of the Force as Kylo Ren, master of the Knights of Ren and
          eventual Supreme Leader of the First Order, but returned to the light side shortly before his death. He was
          born at the end of the Galactic Civil War in 5 ABY, when the Galactic Empire surrendered to the New Republic.
          His parents, General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, were considered great heroes of the Alliance to
          Restore the Republic, as was his maternal uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The heir to the Skywalker
          bloodline, Ben Solo possessed raw strength in the Force and had the potential for limitless power. During the
          New Republic Era, Solo was part of a new generation of Jedi apprentices trained by his uncle. He was seduced
          by the dark side through the machinations of the phantom Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, and his
          creation, Supreme Leader Snoke. Sidious's son had a daughter, Rey, who was born to her mother in 15 ABY.
          Unknown to any at the time, Solo and Rey were counterparts as a dyad in the Force.

          Rose Tico served in the Resistance as a maintenance worker during their conflict with the First Order, whom
          Tico had hated since she was a child. Tico's older sister, Paige, was a gunner in the Resistance. Following
          the Battle of D'Qar, in which her sister was killed, and during the First Order's attack on the Resistance
          fleet, Tico, former Stormtrooper Finn, and astromech unit BB-8 arrived on the city of Canto Bight to recruit
          the &quot;Master Codebreaker,&quot; hoping he could disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker. Instead
          allying with criminal DJ, the four were captured before they could disable the tracker and betrayed by DJ. In
          the ensuing Battle of Crait, Tico saved Finn's life and, although unconscious, was among the members of the
          Resistance who escaped aboard the Millennium Falcon.

        <li><a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/#year=11&character=Finn">Finn</a>

          Finn, formerly designated FN-2187 (&quot;Eight-Seven&quot;), was a Force-sensitive person, and stormtrooper
          who served the First Order until his desertion and subsequent defection to the Resistance during the First
          Order/Resistance War. Though trained since birth to be a loyal and obedient soldier, FN-2187's conscience
          conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a time he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping
          to escape the galactic conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As the galaxy
          became consumed by war, the renegade trooper was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay.

          Rey was a Jedi Master who fought on the side of the Resistance in the war against the First Order. A former
          scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New
          Republic Era. Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that
          awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her
          commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her
          anger and the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior
          Kylo Ren. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force. Rey was born
          a Palpatine, but would take the name of Skywalker, after her masters.

          belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-wing
          starfighter.
